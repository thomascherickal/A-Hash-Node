Draw through source code the Mona Lisa picture using pixels in [C#.NET](http://C#.NET)

Here is some sample [C#.NET](http://C#.NET) code that demonstrates how you can draw the Mona Lisa picture using pixels:

```python
Copy codeusing System;
using System.Drawing;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace MonaLisa
{
    public class MonaLisaForm : Form
    {
        public MonaLisaForm()
        {
            // Set the size of the form
            this.Width = 500;
            this.Height = 500;

            // Set the background color of the form
            this.BackColor = Color.White;
        }

        protected override void OnPaint(PaintEventArgs e)
        {
            // Get the graphics object for the form
            Graphics g = e.Graphics;

            // Set the smoothing mode to high quality
            g.SmoothingMode = System.Drawing.Drawing2D.SmoothingMode.HighQuality;

            // Draw the Mona Lisa using pixels
            for (int x = 0; x < 500; x++)
            {
                for (int y = 0; y < 500; y++)
                {
                    // Set the color of the pixel based on its position
                    Color c = GetColorAt(x, y);

                    // Draw the pixel
                    g.FillRectangle(new SolidBrush(c), x, y, 1, 1);
                }
            }
        }

        private Color GetColorAt(int x, int y)
        {
            // This function determines the color of the pixel at the specified coordinates
            // based on the Mona Lisa image. You would need to implement this function
            // by analyzing the Mona Lisa image and mapping the colors of the pixels
            // to the corresponding coordinates in the form.
            //
            // For example, you might use an image editing tool to determine the color
            // of the pixel at (0, 0) in the Mona Lisa image, and then return that color
            // when this function is called with (0, 0) as the arguments.
        }
    }
}
```

To use this code, you would need to implement the `GetColorAt` function to determine the color of each pixel based on the Mona Lisa image. You could use an image editing tool to determine the colors of the pixels in the image and map them to the corresponding coordinates in the form.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Implement the GetColorAt method fully

Here is a possible implementation of the `GetColorAt` function that determines the color of each pixel based on the Mona Lisa image:

```python
Copy codeprivate Color GetColorAt(int x, int y)
{
    // Load the Mona Lisa image
    Bitmap image = new Bitmap("MonaLisa.png");

    // Return the color of the pixel at the specified coordinates
    return image.GetPixel(x, y);
}
```

This implementation assumes that you have an image file named "MonaLisa.png" in the same directory as your [C#.NET](http://C#.NET) code. The `GetPixel` method of the `Bitmap` class is used to retrieve the color of the pixel at the specified coordinates.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
