*Quantum Computing is in production today with Adiabatic Systems. Even NISQ quantum solutions have great potential!*

# Why Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, was So Wrong About Quantum Computing

Jensen Huang made a very controversial statement during a Q&A at CES 2025.

Basically, he said that practical quantum computers are 20 years in the future and that that was a reasonable estimate.

He is a very smart person, and I respect him a lot, so I’ll assume that he meant quantum computers coming to the individual desktop.

**Because quantum computing systems are already in production for adiabatic quantum computers (the major player here being D-Wave).**

**And Gate-based quantum computing systems, despite facing several challenges, are just the forerunners of a massive revolution that will take place once quantum hardware improves.**

Unlike my usual articles, I am going to link to my sources inline so that you can check and verify my claims by yourself while reading this article.

D-Wave’s CEO had a lot to say about Jensen Huang’s statement (full text linked below):

He has good reasons to make this statement.

## Industrial Uses Already in Production - Adiabatic Quantum Systems

[**D-Wave**](https://www.dwavesys.com/?ref=hackernoon.com) has **quantum annealers (the optimization method used in adiabatic systems)**.

**They are the first quantum computing company that has actual solutions in production environments and in the industry today.**

Some of their industrial use cases in production today are:

### Logistics Optimization

Momentum Worldwide’s 18,000 brand experience tour planning and optimal logistics optimization involved 4500+ stores across the US. What normally takes months of work took D-Wave one hour.

### Resource Optimization

DOCOMO in Japan needed to configure 270 base stations from the three demonstration regions into different tracking groups. DWave solved the subset of the problem in 40 seconds. Now, the company is exploring putting quantum optimization into place for 250,000 base stations.

### Workforce Scheduling Optimization

For large companies having the right people at the right places is a very difficult problem. A variation of an optimization problem was used to schedule Pattison Food Group, a company in Canada, resulting in an 80% reduction of the workload.

There are hundreds of cases where quantum optimization can help businesses.

## What About Other Quantum Companies That Use Gate-Based Quantum Technology?

![Superconducting Qubits Require Special Environments!](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2f9f3987-d668-48ee-813c-c98ad8145f69_800x800.jpeg align="left")

*Superconducting Qubits Require Special Environments!*

These companies, such as IBM (the leader in this space), Google, Microsoft, Rigetti, and IonQ have significant challenges to overcome.

Significantly, they need to address:

* **Qubit Decoherence:**
    
    Qubits are highly sensitive to their environment, and interactions with external factors can cause them to lose their quantum properties, a phenomenon known as decoherence. This limits the time available for computations.
    

* **Scalability**
    
    Current quantum computers are relatively small, and scaling them to hundreds or thousands of qubits while maintaining coherence and low error rates is a major challenge.
    

* **Error Correction**
    
    Quantum systems are prone to errors due to noise and decoherence. Developing reliable quantum error correction techniques is essential for building practical quantum computers.
    

* **Control and Calibration**
    
    As the number of qubits increases, controlling individual qubits becomes increasingly complex. Calibration of control electronics is also challenging.
    

* **Hardware Development**
    
    Creating high-quality quantum hardware, including qubits and control electronics, remains a significant challenge. Different qubit technologies have varying strengths and weaknesses.
    

* **Computational Speed**
    
    Gate operations must occur quickly enough to complete computations before qubits lose coherence. The speed at which gates can be executed is limited by the control electronics.
    

* **Multi-Qubit Networking**
    
    Linking multiple qubits together for gate operations is essential for implementing quantum algorithms. However, creating entanglement across more than two qubits remains a challenge.
    

**Therefore, NISQ systems have very real problems.**

**This is possibly one of the reasons for Jensen Huang’s statement:**

**Even quantum computing researchers doubt that real-world algorithms can be built on NISQ systems.**

**But - we have a very promising future for quantum computing in the near future.**

**Why?**

**Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing (FTQC for short)!**

## Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing: The Next Quantum Leap (Double Pun Intended)

![There have been incredible challenges in the NISQ era](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa7659cc2-4251-4e0a-9a2e-03dbb456b714_800x800.jpeg align="left")

*There have been incredible challenges in the NISQ era*

**Some researchers believe that we are on the cusp of a new era.**

**Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing, or FTQC, for short.**

## Conclusion

This time, the references are in the text, so there is no list of references!

Quantum Computing and AGI are perhaps the two most exciting scientific challenges of our time.

And China is well ahead of the Western world in quantum computing.

The US and EU need to play catch-up!

**China spent 15 billion USD on quantum computing in 2024.**

**In comparison, in the same year, the US spent 5 billion.**

Those numbers have to change.

Quantum Computing needs all the research money it can get.

And hopefully - the next wave of quantum computation breakthroughs with FTQC will happen anywhere between 2-4 years.

**And quantum computation should be practical in a decade.**

**Which will happen - with the right mental outlook and research funding.**

**All the very best of luck in your quantum career!**
