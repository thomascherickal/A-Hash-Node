### Quantum StrangeWorks

Believe it or not, this is not an affiliate site or link! **The website is so amazing that it’s a dream for the researcher, the student, the professional, the developer, and the general public alike.** This is the only site you will ever need for all things *quantum.*

Basically, **this site contains every algorithm that quantum computing has tackled so far.** But it does even more. You also get the source code for every algorithm in *all the current quantum development libraries available*!

**This company is supported by Strangeworks, a company that has made all quantum computing libraries commonly used in one single platform.**

Gee whiz, I wonder how fast I would have gone with this website if I had known about it earlier.

There is no faster, quicker, better or more effective way to learn quantum computing for **free!**

#### **Yes — Free!**

No charges!

You learn.

You contribute.

**The entire quantum computation community benefits.**

### Quantum Machine Learning

Ever heard of quantum neural networks? (yes, that’s a neuron above)

Ever heard of quantum genetic algorithms? (Believe it or not, they’ve been around since 1998!)

Here you have a resource to learn them.

***For Free!***

**With source code in multiple quantum programming frameworks and languages.**

**With tutorials for each.**

With material for every level.

Once upon a time, research was done in MIT, Bell Labs, Carnegie Mellon, Ivy League schools —

Everything has changed with the advent of the Internet — and the **coronavirus lockdowns.**

**With the lockdown — everyone works from home.**

Plenty of material is available online.

The next big leap forward could come from an online community, *such as this one!*
