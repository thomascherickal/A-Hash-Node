C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language known for its efficiency and direct hardware access. It's commonly used in systems programming, embedded systems, and high-performance computing.

### #Features:

**Procedural programming:** C follows a structured approach with functions and data structures. **Low-level access:** Direct memory manipulation and hardware interaction are possible. **Pointers:** C uses pointers for memory management, offering flexibility but also potential for errors. **Minimal standard library:** C relies on external libraries for many functionalities.

C Code Sample:
--------------

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <stdlib.h>
    
    typedef struct {
        int data;
        struct node *next;
    } node_t;
    
    node_t *create_node(int data) {
        node_t *new_node = (node_t *)malloc(sizeof(node_t));
        if (new_node == NULL) {
            return NULL; // Memory allocation failed
        }
        new_node->data = data;
        new_node->next = NULL;
        return new_node;
    }
    
    node_t *insert_at_head(node_t *head, int data) {
        node_t *new_node = create_node(data);
        if (new_node == NULL) {
            return head; // Memory allocation failed
        }
        new_node->next = head;
        return new_node;
    }
    
    void print_list(node_t *head) {
        node_t *current = head;
        while (current != NULL) {
            printf("%d -> ", current->data);
            current = current->next;
        }
        printf("NULL\n");
    }
    
    int main() {
        node_t *head = NULL;
        head = insert_at_head(head, 5);
        head = insert_at_head(head, 3);
        head = insert_at_head(head, 1);
        print_list(head);
        // ... (Memory deallocation would be necessary here in C)
        return 0;
    } 

#Rust Comparison:
-----------------

**Rust Equivalent (Systems Programming with Safety)**

    struct Node {
        data: i32,
        next: Option<Box<Node>>,
    }
    
    impl Node {
        fn new(data: i32) -> Box<Node> {
            Box::new(Node { data, next: None })
        }
    }
    
    fn insert_at_head(head: Option<Box<Node>>, data: i32) -> Option<Box<Node>> {
        Some(Box::new(Node { data, next: head }))
    }
    
    fn print_list(head: &Option<Box<Node>>) {
        let mut current = head;
        while let Some(node) = current {
            print!("{} -> ", node.data);
            current = &node.next;
        }
        println!("NULL");
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let mut head = None;
        head = insert_at_head(head, 5);
        head = insert_at_head(head, 3);
        head = insert_at_head(head, 1);
        print_list(&head); // No manual memory deallocation needed
    }

This Rust code achieves the same functionality using ownership and `Box` pointers for memory safety, ensuring no memory leaks.

**Explanation:**

*   Both code snippets create a linked list and insert nodes at the head.
    
*   C requires explicit memory allocation (`malloc`) and deallocation, while Rust manages memory automatically through ownership.
    
*   Rust's `Option` and `Box` types ensure safe memory handling and prevent dangling pointers.
    

**Memory safety**: Rust eliminates the risk of memory leaks and dangling pointers through its ownership and borrowing system, preventing common C pitfalls. **Modern features**: Rust offers features like closures, pattern matching, and generics, enhancing code expressiveness. **Package management**: Rust's cargo simplifies dependency management and build processes.

### Applications:

#### C:

Operating systems, embedded systems, drivers.

#### Rust:

Systems programming with higher safety and reliability, web backends, CLI tools.

Conclusion:
-----------

While C remains a powerful language for low-level development, Rust offers a safer and more modern approach to systems programming and beyond.

2\. Go

### Introduction:

Go is a statically typed, compiled language created at Google. It emphasizes simplicity, concurrency, and efficient compilation.

### Features:

**Concurrency**: Go's goroutines and channels provide lightweight mechanisms for concurrent programming. **Static typing**: Offers type safety and compile-time error checking. **Garbage collection**: Automatic memory management simplifies development but can introduce performance overhead. **Interfaces and structs**: Go provides flexible mechanisms for data abstraction and code organization.

Go Code Sample:
---------------

**Go (Concurrency and Networking)**

    package main
    
    import (
        "fmt" 
        "net/http"
    ) 
    
    func handler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "Hello from Go!")
    } 
    
    func main() {
        http.HandleFunc("/", handler)
        fmt.Println("Server listening on port 8080")
        http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
    } 

This Go code demonstrates building a simple web server using goroutines for concurrency and handling HTTP requests.

**Rust Equivalent (Building High-Performance Web Services)**

    #[macro_use] extern crate rocket; 
    
    #[get("/")]
    fn index() -> &'static str {
      "Hello from Rust!" 
    } 
    
    fn main() {
      rocket::ignite().mount("/", routes![index]).launch();
    }

This Rust code, using the Rocket framework, builds a web server with potential performance advantages over Go due to Rust's efficiency.

### Rust Comparison:

**Memory safety:** Rust's ownership and borrowing system offers stronger guarantees than Go's garbage collection, preventing data races and memory leaks. **Performance:** Rust often exhibits better performance due to zero-cost abstractions and lack of runtime overhead. **Learning curve:** Go's simplicity makes it easier to learn initially, while Rust's ownership system requires more careful consideration.

### Rust Code Sample

    use std::thread; use std::sync::mpsc;

    fn main() { 
    let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel();
     thread::spawn(move || { tx.send("Hello from thread").unwrap();
     }); 
    
    let message = rx.recv().unwrap(); 
    println!("{}", message); 
    } 

Applications
------------

Go: Web services, microservices, network tools. Rust: Performance-critical applications, systems programming, web backends where security and reliability are paramount.

Conclusion:
-----------

Both Go and Rust excel in concurrency and building reliable systems. Rust offers stronger memory safety guarantees and potentially higher performance while Go provides a simpler learning curve and established ecosystem. Choosing between them depends on the specific needs of your project.

### Introduction:

Java is a mature, object-oriented language widely used for enterprise applications, Android development, and web services.

### Features:

**Object-oriented**: Java follows object-oriented principles, promoting code reusability and modularity. **Platform independence:** The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) allows Java code to run on various platforms. **Garbage collection:** Automatic memory management simplifies development but can impact performance. **Extensive ecosystem:** Java has a vast community and numerous libraries and frameworks.

### Java Code Sample:

    import java.util.ArrayList;
    import java.util.List;
    
    class Employee {
        private String name; 
        private int age;
    
        public Employee(String name, int age) {
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        } 
    
        // Getters and setters...
    }
    
    public class Main {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            List<Employee> employees = new ArrayList<>();
            employees.add(new Employee("Alice", 30));
            employees.add(new Employee("Bob", 25));
    
            for (Employee employee : employees) {
                System.out.println(employee.getName() + " (" + employee.getAge() + ")");
            } 
        } 
    }

This Java code showcases object-oriented programming with classes, objects, and collections for a typical enterprise application scenario.
