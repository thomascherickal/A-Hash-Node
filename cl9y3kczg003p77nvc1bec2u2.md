#### These dreams must be in service, ethical, positive, true, personal, but as unrealistic as you like. I’m serious.

If you thought your life is over and you’ll never be good at anything, good for anything, would make no impact on the world, and are destined to lead a life of low-grade mediocrity — **you are wrong. So wrong.**

The only limits applicable to your life are the ones you set yourself.

You are capable of living the life of your dreams.

You are as big as or as small as you think you are. The focus is on your thoughts. This is something you can do. It’s possible to change yourself — with the right reasons and clarity on how life is meant to be lived.

### Then Why Are So Few Truly Happy And So Many Self-Destructive?

Because of negativity.

It’s easier to go with the flow down the river of oblivion than it is to hold on to your dreams and fight for them and believe in yourself.

Negativity in life is the easy dead way of living.

> I’ll never change.

> I’m useless.

> I will never succeed.

> I can’t overcome this addiction.

> I can’t change my current life.

> It’s impossible.

These are the words of the negative voice within us. **We must control that voice, even after it has controlled us for years — maybe even decades. If you want to live a life not worth living, just keep thinking even one of these thoughts. Your own expectations of yourself will come true as if by magic.**

### What Do the Happy, Contented People say?

It’s easy to think you’re a winner if you’ve achieved something significant. Trust me, I know. More on that later!

But it’s also easy to achieve all the success in the world and still feel useless and kill yourself. Just remember Marilyn Monroe.

> The truly successful man is the one who has served others around him.

> “The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.”

But in every truly happy person’s life, there is:

> Self-Esteem — I love who I am and am getting better every day.

> Gratitude — God has given me so much. I’m so lucky to be alive.

> Service — Gosh, I’m helping so many people and I feel so happy because of that.

> Motivation — I am driven by my principles to make the best possible outcome of my life. I love evryone around me.

> Living in the Now — Mindfulness. Just look at this life. Look at the sunset. Observe the innocence of children. The beauty of the present of the moment — there has never been one like it before and there may never be again. This is truly the best time to be alive, ever.

> I’m unique. One of a kind. There has never been anyone exactly like me, and there is never anyone who will be exactly like you. Just be yourself — it’s more than enough.

I once wrote an article about seriously challenged people who made their lives extraordinary.

But now, I want to write an article for you. Personally.

To discover yourself.

To co-create your life with God.

### The Power of the Word

> But I tell you that men will give an account on the day of judgment for every careless word they have spoken. [For](https://biblehub.com/greek/1063.htm "1063: gar (Conj) -- For. A primary particle; properly, assigning a reason.") [by](https://biblehub.com/greek/1537.htm "1537: ek (Prep) -- From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards. A primary preposition denoting origin, from, out.") [your](https://biblehub.com/greek/4771.htm "4771: sou (PPro-G2S) -- You. The person pronoun of the second person singular; thou.") [words](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm "3056: logōn (N-GMP) -- From lego; something said; by implication, a topic, also reasoning or motive; by extension, a computation; specially, the Divine Expression.") [you will be acquitted,](https://biblehub.com/greek/1344.htm "1344: dikaiōthēsē (V-FIP-2S) -- From dikaios; to render just or innocent.") [and](https://biblehub.com/greek/2532.htm "2532: kai (Conj) -- And, even, also, namely. ") [by](https://biblehub.com/greek/1537.htm "1537: ek (Prep) -- From out, out from among, from, suggesting from the interior outwards. A primary preposition denoting origin, from, out.") [your](https://biblehub.com/greek/4771.htm "4771: sou (PPro-G2S) -- You. The person pronoun of the second person singular; thou.") [words](https://biblehub.com/greek/3056.htm "3056: logōn (N-GMP) -- From lego; something said; by implication, a topic, also reasoning or motive; by extension, a computation; specially, the Divine Expression.") [you will be condemned.](https://biblehub.com/greek/2613.htm "2613: katadikasthēsē (V-FIP-2S) -- To condemn, pass sentence upon. From kata and a derivative of dike; to adjudge against, i.e. Pronounce guilty.")

We are made in the image and likeness of God. Thus, we are immortal.

> For God created man to be immortal, and made him to be an image of his own eternity. Nevertheless through envy of the devil came death into the world: and they that do hold of his side do find it.

God said, and so it was.

> And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light.

**Similarly, what we say also comes true.**

> I am going to lose a lot of weight, get a fantastic job, and get married to a wonderful person.

Or you could think:

> I’m useless. I’ve tried everything and succeeded at nothing. This is my karma — this is my fate.

**And we say these affirmations to ourselves thousands of times a day.**

50,000 thoughts run through the average human mind in one day.

I like the way the legendary composer **Yanni** puts it:

> “And I just want you to remember one more thing — that everything good, that has ever happened, in the history of humanity, has begun as a single thought, in someone’s mind. And if any of us is capable of thinking such a great thought, then we all have that capacity — that capability. For we are all the same.”

It’s not easy.

It’s uphill.

It’s a struggle.

**But it’s worth it.**

**If it serves others, is altruistic, and inherently positive.**

You can create your own life with your thoughts.

**The right thoughts repeated the right number of times, often in the face of an apparent impossibility, can lead you to the right life.**

### All This is Great. But Where Do I Start?

Journal.

Write down your thoughts.

See them on paper.

Sometimes that shows you how dumb it was to think negatively.

**Every person can rise to their ultimate potential.**

**If your life is worthy to be lived, it’s worthy to be recorded.**

**Record every bit of your life.**

Yes, it’s costly. Choose your platform wisely.

Even go for the premium plan if you can.

I also recommend the Calm mindfulness app, available below:

### OK, So We Have the How. What About Why?

Why is it worth it to strive against negativity and see the good in every situation?

**The answer is simple — serving others.**

> The greatest need of the human heart is to live for a cause greater than oneself. — Robin Sharma

**Serve. Your family. Your neighborhood. Your country. Even the world.**

**Do random acts of kindness.**

**Be empathetic to the needy.**

**Serve the poor.**

**Serve a greater cause.**

If you are self-centered, want things for yourself, to your plan, for your desires; you will never get anywhere.

You will be confined to the chains of the inward self. And live in self-pity all your life.

**Serve.**

**Serve.**

**Serve.**

**Serve.**

…...

> Live out of the glory of your imagination. — Robin Sharma

> Because ‘the potential you’ can one day become ‘the real you.’

The real you is not the person in the mirror.

The real you is not what others think of you.

The real you depends on what you think about yourself.

**And the real you is the potential success that can emerge in your future through your thoughts. By controlling the positivity of your thoughts.**

***And, that, my brother, is how you will, soon, live the life of your dreams.***

**Be brave and bold. Take the path to the stars, not through the mud.**

**Bravery is necessary.**

**Persistence is necessary.**

But:

> He who does not give up, wins. — Mathew Jacob

*You can do this.*

*I believe in you.*

*And God believes in you even more.*

*That’s why he created you.*

*To serve as he served.*

*To live as he lived.*

*To become immortal from being mortal.*

*I hope you will see the truth of these words.*

*Amen.*
