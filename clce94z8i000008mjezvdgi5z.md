*Here is an outline of how you can create a full-stack email application in Python using Django:*

1. *Install Django and create a new Django project and app.*
    

```python
Copy codepip install django
django-admin startproject myproject
cd myproject
python manage.py startapp myapp
```

1. *Design the models for your email application. An email model will need at least the following fields: subject, message, from email, to email, and date sent. You can also include additional fields such as cc and bcc if needed.*
    

```python
Copy codefrom django.db import models

class Email(models.Model):
    subject = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    message = models.TextField()
    from_email = models.EmailField()
    to_email = models.EmailField()
    cc_email = models.EmailField(blank=True)
    bcc_email = models.EmailField(blank=True)
    date_sent = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
```

1. *Create a form for sending emails. This form will allow users to enter the subject, message, and recipient information for their emails.*
    

```python
Copy codefrom django import forms

class EmailForm(forms.Form):
    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=255)
    message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
    to_email = forms.EmailField()
    cc_email = forms.EmailField(required=False)
    bcc_email = forms.EmailField(required=False)
```

1. *Create a view for the email form. This view will render the form template and handle form submission.*
    

```python
Copy codefrom django.shortcuts import render, redirect
from .forms import EmailForm

def send_email(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        form = EmailForm(request.POST)
        if form.is_valid():
            # send email
            return redirect('success')
    else:
        form = EmailForm()
    return render(request, 'myapp/send_email.html', {'form': form})
```

1. *Create a template for the email form. This template will contain the HTML for the email form and will be rendered by the view.*
    

```python
Copy code<form method="post">
    {% csrf_token %}
    {{ form.as_p }}
    <input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>
```

1. *Configure the Django settings to use a email backend for sending emails. There are several email backends available in Django, such as SMTP, file-based, and in-memory.*
    

```python
Copy codeEMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@example.com'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your-email-password'
```

1. *Test the email application by running the Django development server and submitting the email form.*
    

```python
Copy codepython manage.py runserver
```
