# The Agentic AI Work Situation

We have all heard that AI agents are going to transform the workplace.

Some companies have even stopped hiring developers as a result, anticipating that automation will enable the work for them. ([source](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-lays-off-over-1000-workers-to-make-room-for-ai-focused-roles/))

These have led some to conclude that the effect of AI agents will be felt in every job, not just entry-level ones. ([source](https://www.hrkatha.com/special/editorial/2025-workplace-trends-why-agentic-ai-threatens-our-job/))

Many other companies are laying off tech workers wholesale, with Microsoft and Meta laying off 10,000 tech workers each. ([source](https://anz.peoplemattersglobal.com/article/learning-technology/top-companies-cutting-jobs-due-to-ai-a-2024-overview-42399#expand%5Farticle%5Fid))

What can technology workers do, in this sort of an environment?

Answer:

**Specialize in AI Agents.**

**Skill up on the technology that every company wants to use!**

## AI Agents - A Quick Overview

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbfc98138-b5bb-4741-a475-c525b67a6ef0_1024x768.jpeg align="left")

Traditional AI required humans to guide them at every step.

These AIs are now being replaced with AI agents, which require very little human intervention.

AI Agents have the following behavior.

* They are computational entities residing within a digital environment.
    

* They observe the world around them through APIs, database queries, user interface interactions, network traffic, or even log files.
    

* They act on that information provided by writing data to a database, sending API requests, modifying website content, triggering system processes, or displaying information to a user.
    

* They are mostly built with LLMs as a backend that provides them with additional intelligence and cognition features.
    

They have certain characteristics that separate them from traditional AI - a quick recap:

* **Autonomy:**
    
* A software AI agent operates without constant, direct human programming during runtime.
    
* It can make decisions and take actions based on its internal reasoning and goals within its digital environment
    

* **Reactivity:**
    
* Reactivity is the agent's ability to sense these changes through its digital sensors and react on time.
    
* This responsiveness is crucial for agents to adapt to evolving digital landscapes and maintain effectiveness.
    

* **Proactiveness with Goals:**
    
* Intelligent software agents are not just reactive; they are proactive.
    
* They take the initiative to achieve their defined goals within the digital environment.
    

* **Social Ability or Communication:**
    

* Social ability refers to an agent's capacity to communicate, cooperate, and potentially negotiate with other digital entities.
    
* This is crucial for complex software systems where multiple agents collaborate to achieve larger goals.
    

* **Learning:**
    
* A key aspect of intelligent software agents is their ability to learn from digital data and experience.
    
* Learning agents can improve their performance over time by analyzing past interactions within their digital environment.
    

* **Adaptability:**
    
* Adaptability is the ability of a software agent to modify its behavior in response to changes in the digital environment.
    
* This goes beyond simple reactivity and involves more profound adjustments to the agent's strategies and knowledge.
    

* **Rationality:**
    
* Rationality means making the best possible decision given the available digital information and computational resources.
    
* A rational agent will weigh different digital actions and choose the one most likely to lead to success in its software domain.
    

## #**Building Software AI Agents**

![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5d4abcad-e6cc-41ea-9e78-1bd9e97fa5f0_1024x768.jpeg align="left")

Agentic design is not always trivial.

You need to:

1. Define the purpose clearly.
    
2. Choose the algorithm and agent architecture that you will use.
    
3. Design the agent using Python/Java/C++ or agent-specific languages.
    
4. Choose the backend LLM that you are going to use (Google Gemini is recommended for budget, speed and performance)
    
5. Integrate the API’s that you are going to use and
    
6. Test the effectiveness of the agent in a controlled environment and optimize your algorithms
    
7. Incorporate learning and adaptability using scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, or JAX.
    
8. Deploy and monitor your AI agent while preparing for failures and adjusting for errors.
    

This is a complex, time-consuming process.

However, what if I told you that coding is not the only way?

What if there were no-code or low-code tools that greatly simplify agent creation?

Well - these tools and platforms do exist!

And there is more.

Not only do tools exist that simplify AI agent creation, but there are AI agent marketplaces that allow you to buy high-performing agents with cash/crypto and use them with full freedom for your use case.

And use cases exist everywhere.

AI agents can be used in almost every situation that a human being could be utilize, digitally.

The list of use cases is too long to include in this article.

**Bill Gates was asked which careers would survive the AI supremacy.**

His answer?

1. *Software Developers & AI Engineers*
    
2. *Energy Sector Professionals*
    
3. *Life Sciences Expert and Biologists*
    

([source](https://www.thehansindia.com/tech/ai/bill-gates-identifies-three-jobs-that-will-survive-ai-disruption-944570))

I think he’s being too generous.

**I think only AI Engineers will survive, seeing that Software Developers any rung below senior level are being replaced already!**

So now we (finally) come to the real meat of this article.

**Here are 20 AI Agent Platforms and Marketplaces that you can use to:**

* **Build, deploy, and sell your AI agents to others**
    
* **Use AI agents for your business needs**
    

I warn you that buying AI agents is available only on a subset of this list, not every platform listed has this feature.

However, every platform listed below will help you build AI agents, and some allow you to use no-code or low-code solutions!

* This AI app market has changed the very fabric of reality for generative AI apps.
    
* Its ecosystem consists of all types of applications, and it is only going to grow virally in the future.
    

## Conclusion: Welcome to the Future

Python is easy enough to learn.

But to survive, I strongly recommend that all developers, regardless of their speciality, learn generative AI and specialize in AI agents.

Bill Gates is a wise man, but I believe that the demand for AI engineers will be far greater than the demand for biologists or energy sector experts.

**Be smart.**

**Hop on to the Generative AI and AI Agents train heading for the moon if not the stars early on in your career.**

And learn and specialize in some of the platforms mentioned in the list.

I recommend starting with the HuggingFace AI App Market.

*All the very best of luck to you!*
