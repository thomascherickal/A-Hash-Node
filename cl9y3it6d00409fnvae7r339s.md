You are trying to code. Things in your mind are hazy, you are tired, frustrated, and irritated by the slow pace you are going while others are waltzing through the same exercises that you’re trying to do. And they’re having a ball! **You’ve been stuck on one issue for hours!** Then the spirit of discouragement seeps through you, and you think:

> “Maybe Coding Isn’t For Me — Maybe Others Can Do It, But I Can’t!” (your impostor syndrome speaking)

**This thought, if not addressed, can destroy your career.**

> **You can have the potential to be a wonderful software engineer, and still destroy your own career if you don’t control or are not aware of the negative self-talk going on within you.**

Understand what is happening. Your own brain is sabotaging you. You’ve been staring at a computer screen for hours, and you just don’t see an answer or a way out.

This is why so many people say they can’t code — negative self-talk. Impostor syndrome.

**Everyone can code. You just need to believe in yourself.**

**No, really. Saying you can’t learn to code is a misunderstanding.**

Everyone can code. But different people have different ways of working. **You need to find yours.**

There is a fundamental rule to solve this problem, and it is very simple.

**Take a Break. Recharge Your Batteries. Put the coding aside, and do something else that is fun and *physical*.**

So What Should You Do? You Have a Huge Number of Options — **I’m giving you the secret key to unlock your brain, bring it under your control, and teach yourself how to code by motivating yourself — so pay attention!**

#### Get Physical

You have been sitting in one place for hours. You are tired and depressed. You believe that this (coding) might not be your path forward.

**Bro/sis, at some time or the other, every serious coder experiences that.**

Impostor syndrome is something everyone goes through.

**Yehudi Menuhin was undoubtedly the 20th century’s best violinist.**

**But even he had a mental issue of impostor syndrome after experimenting with meditation and yoga and had a breakdown, during which he didn’t play violin for two years!**

> Do you think you’re better than **Yehudi Menuhin**?

The Guardian

**You need to recharge.** Your brain is full of negative chemicals that encourage depression and boredom. You are weary of sitting on this problem with no answer on its way.

**The answer is not in persevering with the problem as long as you can.**

**The answer is to take your mind off your code. Completely.**

Go play football — table tennis — basketball — badminton — **any physical activity, even running, running on the spot, jogging, skipping, and so on.**

Preferably with a team.

**Forget the problem completely.**

Sweat! Really work out.

Take a bath.

Rest. Relax.

And come back, after some time (**break time anywhere between two hours to one day**).

You will find (if you have really worked out, sw Henry Fordeated it out, bathed, and rested) that you are completely refreshed!

**You’ve just pressed F5 on your own self!**

**Swimming is excellent for this. Really excellent.**

#### What Just Happened?

Your brain was full of the chemicals that govern anxiety, depression, frustration, and tension (while working on the computer).

You just got rid of all these chemicals and gave yourself a huge shot of endorphins, in particular dopamine, by exercising your heart out.

What happens when you have a lot of dopamine in your brain?

Just read the link below:

*Dopamine is an important chemical messenger in the brain that has many functions.

**The best ways to increase dopamine naturally are aerobic exercise, sleep, plenty of sunlight, positive thinking, and mindfulness.**

So now you are recharged, and you are fresh. You will be better equipped to solve your problem, especially if your mind has been completely off work!

**And you will solve your problem.**

**Believe it and you will.**

> **If you think you can do something, or you can’t — either way — you’re right.**
