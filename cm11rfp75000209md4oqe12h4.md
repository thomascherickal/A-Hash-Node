## My Take

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1726294651159/02d85eeb-c7a1-421d-9b0b-6b3cf648f96e.jpeg align="center")

Yup, back to me again.

While some of these ideas are already underway in some form or another, there is no global leader in any of these areas.

I am so pumped by these ideas that I will dedicate some articles to some of these use cases discussing them in detail.

The intellectual property tokenization model and the supply chain revolutionizing the blockchain system will be written in the next few days.

I’m intellectually salivating at the mere concept!

But first - I want to write about quantum-resistant cryptography and the need to develop these techniques before quantum computing becomes viable - not after.

That’s the classic case of putting the cart before the horse.

Way to go, Claude and Anthropic.

All these ideas are great.

And all of them could become multibillion-dollar enterprises.

What are your thoughts?

Feel free to comment below.

Especially - comment as startups who are already working on these ideas.

I want to hear from you.

The entire world does!

Cheers!
